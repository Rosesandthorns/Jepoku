# Jepoku Game Modes Explained

This document provides a brief overview of each game mode available in Jepoku.

## Main Modes

### Easy Mode
- **Grid Size**: 3x3
- **Criteria**: The simplest set, focusing on fundamental traits like Pokémon types (e.g., Fire, Water), regions (e.g., Kanto, Johto), and basic evolution status ("Can Evolve", "Final Evolution").
- **Goal**: Guess the common trait for each of the 3 rows and 3 columns.

### Normal Mode
- **Grid Size**: 3x3
- **Criteria**: A balanced set of criteria that includes types, regions, and more specific traits like "Mega Evolution", "Legendary", and some common abilities or moves.
- **Goal**: Guess the common trait for each of the 3 rows and 3 columns.

### Hard Mode
- **Grid Size**: 3x3
- **Criteria**: The most difficult set of criteria, focusing on nuanced details like base stat values (e.g., "Above 100 Speed"), specific and less common moves/abilities, and Base Stat Totals (BST).
- **Goal**: Guess the common trait for each of the 3 rows and 3 columns.

### Dual Mode
- **Grid Size**: 3x3
- **Criteria**: A combination of Normal and Hard criteria.
- **Mechanic**: Each row and column has *two* criteria that you must guess: one from the "Normal" pool and one from the "Hard" pool. Each Pokémon on the grid must satisfy all four criteria for its position (two for its row, two for its column).
- **Goal**: Guess all 12 criteria correctly.

### Crossword Mode
- **Grid Size**: Variable crossword grid.
- **Clues**: Pokémon types (e.g., "Fire / Flying").
- **Mechanic**: A classic crossword puzzle where all the answers are Pokémon names. You must fill in the grid based on the type combination clues provided for each "Across" and "Down" entry.
- **Goal**: Correctly fill out the entire crossword with the right Pokémon names.

## Challenge Modes

### Dex Mode
- **Grid Size**: 3x3
- **Criteria**: Uses only Pokémon types (e.g., Fire, Water, etc.).
- **Mechanic**: Instead of Pokémon images, the grid is filled with either a Pokémon's Pokédex number or a flavor text entry from one of its games. You must identify the Pokémon from these text-based clues.
- **Goal**: Guess the common type for each of the 3 rows and 3 columns.

### Sprite Mode
- **Grid Size**: 3x3
- **Criteria**: Uses the "Normal Mode" criteria set.
- **Mechanic**: The Pokémon on the grid are displayed only as silhouettes. You must identify them and their common traits based on their shape alone.
- **Goal**: Guess the common trait for each of the 3 rows and 3 columns.

### Timer Mode
- **Grid Size**: 3x3 (multiple puzzles)
- **Criteria**: Uses the "Easy Mode" criteria set.
- **Goal**: Solve 5 puzzles back-to-back within a single 60-second timer. The timer does not reset between puzzles. You win by solving all 5 before time runs out.

### Blinded Mode
- **Grid Size**: 6x6
- **Criteria**: Uses the "Normal Mode" criteria set.
- **Mechanic**: The grid is much larger, and only a fraction of the Pokémon are visible. You must deduce the criteria based on the limited information you have.
- **Goal**: Guess the common trait for each of the 6 rows and 6 columns.

### Order Mode
- **Grid Size**: 16 Pokémon in a list
- **Criteria**: Players are asked to sort the 16 Pokémon based on a specific criterion like Pokedex Number, Height, Weight, or a base stat (HP, Speed, etc.).
- **Goal**: Drag and drop the Pokémon into the correct order. A score of 80% accuracy or higher is a pass.

### Odd One Out
- **Grid Size**: 5x5
- **Criteria**: Uses the "Normal Mode" criteria set.
- **Mechanic**: A single Pokémon in each row and column is an "imposter" that does not fit the criteria for that row OR column.
- **Goal**: Correctly guess all 10 criteria AND select the 5 imposter Pokémon on the grid.

### Miss Matched
- **Grid Size**: 3x3 (with one empty slot)
- **Criteria**: Uses the "Normal Mode" criteria set.
- **Mechanic**: The board starts with 8 Pokémon in scrambled positions and one empty tile. One random criterion is revealed to help you start. You must slide the Pokémon around to place them in a position that satisfies their corresponding row and column criteria.
- **Goal**: Arrange all 8 Pokémon into a valid configuration and guess the remaining 5 criteria.

### Imposter
- **Grid Size**: 3x3
- **Criteria**: Uses the "Hard Mode" criteria set.
- **Mechanic**: Similar to "Odd One Out," but on a smaller grid with more difficult criteria. There is only a single imposter on the entire board.
- **Goal**: Correctly guess all 6 criteria AND select the one imposter Pokémon.

### Criteria Mode
- **Grid Size**: 1 Pokémon to guess
- **Criteria**: A series of clues are revealed every 15 seconds from a large, varied pool.
- **Mechanic**: A 2-minute timer starts. The player must guess the Pokémon's name based on an expanding, randomly ordered list of clues.
- **Goal**: Guess the Pokémon before time runs out.

### Easy Criteria Mode
- **Grid Size**: 1 Pokémon to guess
- **Criteria**: A small set of basic clues are revealed every 15 seconds.
- **Mechanic**: A 2-minute timer starts. The player must guess the Pokémon's name based on an expanding, fixed-order list of clues (e.g., Type 1, Type 2, Region...).
- **Goal**: Guess the Pokémon before time runs out.
